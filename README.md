# RocketCalculator
This is a simple calculator that calculates the parameters necessary to build a rocket. 

The calculator is optimized for LOX and Kerosene, so any rockets using other propellants may need to edit the source code in order to get accurate data.

Data is outputted into an excel spreadsheet, along with terminal outputs.

Follow this to use:

`$ PATH/RocketCalculator cd src`

`$ PATH/RocketCalculator/src python3 app.py`

or if not using python3:

`$ PATH/RocketCalculator/src python app.py`

Then follow the prompts within terminal.
